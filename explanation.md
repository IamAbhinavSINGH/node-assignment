### Dependencies:

- express: For handling HTTP requests.
- express-rate-limit: To limit the rate of requests.
- fs and path: For file operations and path management.
- Bull: For task queueing.
- ioredis: For Redis connection.

### Redis and Queue Initialization:

Creates a Redis client.
Initializes a Bull queue named task-queue using Redis.

### Rate Limiting
- Rate Limiter Configuration:
- Limits requests to 20 per minute per user (user_id).
- Returns a 429 status if the rate limit is exceeded.

### Task Function
- task(user_id) Function:
- Logs task completion with user_id and timestamp to task-log.txt.
- Appends logs to the file.

## Routes
1. Root Route (GET /):

    Simple endpoint to verify server functionality.

2. Task Route (POST /task):

    Receives user_id from the request body.
    Calculates delay to ensure a 1-second gap between tasks for the same user.
    
    Adds a job to the Bull queue with the calculated delay.
    Updates lastExecutionTime to track the next allowable task time.

### Queue Processing
    Task Queue Processing:
    Processes jobs from the queue by executing the task(user_id) function.
